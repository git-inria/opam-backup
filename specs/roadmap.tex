\section*{Overview}

This document specifies the design of a package management system for
OCaml (OPAM). For the first version of OPAM, we have tried to consider
the simplest design choices, even if these choices restrict user
possibilities (but we hope not too much). Our goal is to propose a
system that we can build in a few months. Some of the design choices
might evolve to more complex tasks later, if needed. \\

A package management system has typically two kinds of users: {\em
  end-users} who install and use packages for their own projects; and
{\em packagers}, who create and upload packages. End-users want to
install on their machine a consistent collection of {\em packages} --
a package being a collection of OCaml libraries and/or programs.
Packagers want to take a collection of their own libraries and
programs and make them available to other developpers.

This document describes the fonctional requirements for both kinds of
users.

\subsection*{Conventions}

In this document, \verb+$home+, \verb+$opam+ and \verb+$package+ are
assumed to be defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\tt \$home} refers to the end-user home path, typically {\tt
  /home/thomas/} on linux, {\tt /Users/thomas/} on OSX {\tt
  C:\textbackslash Documents and Settings\textbackslash
  thomas\textbackslash} on Windows.

\item {\tt \$opam} refers to the filesystem subtree containing the
  client state. Default directory is {\tt \$home/.opam}.

\item {\tt \$package} refers to a path in the packager filesystem, where
  lives the collection of libraries and programs he wants to package.

\end{itemize}

User variables are written in capital letters, prefixed by \verb+$+. For
instance package names will be written \verb+$NAME+, package versions
\verb+$VERSION+, and the version of the ocaml compiler currently
installed \verb+$OVERSION+.

\section{Milestone 1: Foundations}

The first milestone of OPAM focuses on providing a limited set of
features, dedicated to package management of OCaml packages. OPAM rely
on external tools to compile and provide full configuration options to
the build tools. The goal for this first milestone is to be as much as
possible compatible with any existing build system (including {\tt
  ocamlfind} and {\tt oasis}) modulo few modifications.

\subsection{Client state}
\label{client}

The client state is stored on the filesystem, under {\tt \$opam}:

\subsubsection{Global state}

\begin{itemize}

\item {\tt \$opam/config} is the main configuration file. It defines
  the OPAM version, the repository addresses and the current compiler
  version. The file format is described in \S\ref{config}.

\item \verb+$opam/opam/$NAME.$VERSION.opam+ is the OPAM specification
  for the package \verb+$NAME+ with version \verb+$VERSION+ (which
  might not be installed). The format of OPAM files is described in
  \S\ref{dotopam}.

\item \verb+$opam/descr/$NAME.$VERSION+ contains the description for the
  version \verb+$VERSION+ of package \verb+$NAME+ (which might not be
  installed). The first line of this file is the package synopsis.

\item \verb+$opam/archives/$NAME.$VERSION.tar.gz+ contains the source
  archives for the version \verb+$VERSION+ of package \verb+$NAME+.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Compiler-specific state}

All the configurations files, libraries and binaries related to the
specific \verb+$OVERSION+ of the OCaml compiler are stored in
\verb+$opam/$OVERSION+.

\begin{itemize}

\item \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/installed+ is the list of installed
  packages for the compiler version \verb+$OVERSION+. The file format
  is described in \S\ref{installed}.

\item \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/config/$NAME.config+ is a
  platform-specific configuration file of for the installed package
  \verb+$NAME+ with the compiler version \verb+$OVERSION+. The file
  format is described in \S\ref{dotconfig}.
  \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/config/+ can be shortened to \verb+$config/+
  for more readability.

\item \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/install/$NAME.install+ is a
  platform-specific package installation file for the installed
  package \verb+$NAME+ with the compiler version \verb+$OVERSION+. The
  file format is described in \S\ref{dotinstall}.
  \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/install+ can be shortened to \verb+$install/+
  for more readability.

\item \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/lib/$NAME/+ contains the libraries
  associated to the installed package \verb+$NAME+ with the compiler
  version \verb+$OVERSION+. \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/lib/+ can be
  shortened to \verb+$lib/+ for more readability.

\item \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/doc/$NAME/+ contains the documentation
  associated to the installed package {\tt NAME} with the compiler
  version \verb+$OVERSION+. /\verb+$opam/OVERSION/doc/+ can be
  shortened to \verb+$doc/+ for more readability.

\item \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/bin/+ contains the program files for all
  installed packages with the compiler version
  \verb+$OVERSION+. \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/bin/+ can be shortened to
  \verb+$bin/+ for more readability.

\item \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/build/$NAME.$VERSION/+ is a tempory folder
  used to build package \verb+$NAME+ with version \verb+$VERSION+,
  with compiler version \verb+$OVERSION+.\verb+$opam/$OVERSION/build/+
  can be shortened to \verb+$build/+ for more readability.

\item \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/reinstall+ contains the list of packages
  wich has been changed upstream since the last upgrade. This can
  happen for instance when a packager uploads a new archive or fix the
  OPAM file for a specific package version. Every package appearing in
  this file will be reinstalled (or upgraded if a new version is
  available) during the next upgrade when the current version of the
  compiler is \verb+$OVERSION+. The file format is similar to the one
  described in \S\ref{installed}.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Repository-specific state}
\label{state-repo}

Configuration files for OPAM repositories \verb+REPO+ are stored in
\verb+$opam/repo/$REPO+. Repositories can be of different kinds
(stored on the local filesystem, available via HTTP, available using a
custom binary protocol, stored under git, $\ldots$); they all share
the same base filesystem which is initialized using the {\tt
  opam-<kind>-init} script (see \S\ref{script-init}) and use only the
{\tt opam-<kind>-update} (see \S\ref{script-update}) and {\tt
  opam-<kind>-upload} (see \S\ref{script-upload}) scripts to exchange
data between the client and the corresponding OPAM repository.

\begin{itemize}

\item \verb+$opam/repo/index+ contains the location of packages
  (ie. in which repositories they can be found and the priority
  between repositories). The file format is described in
  \ref{index}.

\item \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/kind+ contains the kind associated to the
  OPAM repository \verb+$REPO+ have. The kind is stored as a single
  word (containing only letters and digits) and specifies which {\tt
    opam-<kind>-*} scripts to call when updating and uploading this
  repository.

\item \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/address+ contains the address of the
  OPAM repository \verb+$REPO+. This address is passed as argument to
  the {\tt opam-<kind>-*} scripts.

\item \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/opam/$NAME.$VERSION.opam+ is the OPAM
  specification for the package \verb+$NAME+ with version
  \verb+$VERSION+ (which might not be installed). The format of OPAM
  files is described in \S\ref{dotopam}.

\item \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/descr/$NAME.$VERSION+ contains the textual
  description for the version \verb+$VERSION+ of package \verb+$NAME+
  (which might not be installed). The first line of this file is the
  package synopsis.

\item \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/archives/$NAME.$VERSION.tar.gz+ contains
  the source archives for the version \verb+$VERSION+ of package
  \verb+$NAME+. This folder is populated by calling the corresponding
  {\tt opam-<kind>-download} script (see \S\ref{script-download}).

\item \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/updated+ contains the new available
  packages which have not yet been synchronized with the client
  state. This file is created by the {\tt opam-<kind>-update} script
  (see \S\ref{script-update}). If the file empty, this means that the
  client state is up-to-date. The file format is the same as the one
  described in \S\ref{installed}.

\item \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/upload/$NAME.$VERSION/+ contains the
  OPAM, description and archive files to upload to the OPAM repository
  for the version \verb+$VERSION+ of package \verb+$NAME+. The script
  {\tt opam-<kind>-update} script (see \S\ref{script-upload}) read the
  contents of {\tt upload/} and send it to the repository (if the
  repository support upload).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{File syntax}

\subsubsection{List of packages}
\label{installed}

The following configuration files: \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/installed+,
\verb+$opam/$OVERSION/reinstall+, and \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/updated+
follow a very simple syntax. The file is a list of lines which
contains a space-separated name and a version. Each line
\verb+$NAME $VERSION+ means that the version \verb+$VERSION+ of
package \verb+$NAME+ has been compiled with OCaml version
\verb+$OVERSION+ and has been installed on the system in
\verb+$lib/$NAME+ and \verb+$bin/+. \\

For instance, if {\tt batteries} version {\tt 1.0+beta} and {\tt
  ocamlfind} version {\tt 1.2} are installed, then
\verb+$opam/$OVERSION/installed+ will contain:

{\small
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
batteries 1.0+beta
ocamlfind 1.2
\end{Verbatim}
}

\subsubsection{Index of packages}
\label{index}

\verb+$opam/repo/index+ follows a very simple syntax: each line of the
file contains a space separated list of words
\verb+$REPO $NAME $VERSION+ specifying that the version
\verb+$VERSION+ of package \verb+$NAME+ is available in the OPAM
repository \verb+$REPO+. The file contains information on all
available packages (e.g. not only on the installed one). \\

For instance, if {\tt batteries} version {\tt 1.0+beta} is available
in the {\tt testing} repository and {\tt ocamlfind} version {\tt 1.2}
is available in the {\tt default} and testing repositories (where {\tt
  default} is one being used), then \verb+$opam/repo/index+ will
contain:

{\small
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
testing batteries 1.0+beta
default ocamlfind 1.2
testing ocamlfind 1.2
\end{Verbatim}
}

\subsubsection{General syntax}
\label{syntax}

Most of the files in the client and server states share the same
syntax defined in this section.

\begin{description}

\item[Base types] The base types for values are:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt BOOL} is  either {\tt true} or {\tt false}
\item {\tt STRING} is a doubly-quoted OCaml string, for instance: {\tt
  "foo"}, {\tt "foo-bar"}, $\ldots$
\item {\tt SYMBOL} contains only non-letter and non-digit characters,
  for instance: {\tt =}, {\tt <=}, $\ldots$ Some symbols have a special
  meaning and thus are not valid {\tt SYMBOL}s: \verb+(+ \verb+)+
  \verb+[+ \verb+]+ \verb+{+ \verb+}+ \verb+:+
\item {\tt IDENT} starts by a letter and is followed by any number of
  letters, digit and symbols, for instance: {\tt foo}, {\tt foo-bar},
  $\ldots$. 
\end{itemize}


\item[Compound types] Types can be composed together to build more
  complex values:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt X Y } is a space-separated pair of value.
\item {\tt X | Y } is a value of type either {\tt X} or {\tt Y}.
\item {\tt ?X} is zero or one occurrence of a value of type {\tt X}.
\item {\tt X+} is a space-separated list of values of at least one value
  of type {\tt X}.
\item {\tt X*} is a space-separated list of values of values of type
  {\tt X} (it might contain no value).
\end{itemize}

\end{description}

All structured OPAM files share the same syntax:

{\small
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
<file>  := <item>*

<item>  := IDENT : <value>
         | ?IDENT: <value>
         | IDENT STRING { <item>+ }

<value> := BOOL
         | STRING
         | SYMBOL
         | IDENT
         | [ <value>+ ]
         | value ( <value>+ )
\end{Verbatim}
}

\subsubsection{Global configuration file}
\label{config}

\verb+$opam/config+ follows the syntax defined in \S\ref{syntax} with
the following restrictions:

{\small
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
<file> :=
    opam-version: "1.0"
    ?repositories: [ <repo>+ ]
    ocaml-version: STRING

<repo> := STRING ( STRING )
\end{Verbatim}
}

The field {\tt repositories} contains the list of OPAM
repositories with their kind.

The field {\tt ocaml-version} corresponds to the current OCaml
compiler (available in the path).

\subsubsection{Package specification files: {\tt .opam}}
\label{dotopam}

\verb+$opam/opam/$NAME.$VERSION.opam+ follows the syntax defined in
\S\ref{syntax} with the following restrictions:

{\small
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
<file> :=
    opam-version: 1.0
    package STRING {
      version:    STRING
      maintainer: STRING
      ?subst:     [ STRING+ ]
      ?build:     [ command+ ]
      ?depends:   <formula>
      ?conflicts: <formula>
      ?libraries: [ STRING+ ]
      ?syntax:    [ STRING+ ]
    }

<formula>    := STRING
              | STRING ( <constraint> )
              | <formula> '|' <formula>
              | <formula> '&' <formula>
              | ( <formula> )

<constraint> := <comp> STRING
              | <constraint> '|' <constraint>
              | <constraint> '&' <constraint>
              | ( <constraint> )

<comp>       := '=' | '<' | '>' | '>=' | '<='
<command>    := [ STRING+ ]
\end{Verbatim}
}

\begin{itemize}

\item The first line specifies the OPAM version.

\item The string after {\tt package} should not contain any dot ({\tt
  '.'}) nor space ({\tt ' '}).

\item The contents of {\tt version} is \verb+$VERSION+. The content of
  {\tt maintainer} is the contact address of the package maintainer.

\item The content of {\tt subst} is the list of files to substitute
  variable (see \S\ref{subst} for the file format and
  \S\ref{opam-config} for the semantic of file substitution).

\item The content of {\tt build} is the list of commands to run in
  order to build the package libraries. The build script should build
  all the libraries and syntax extensions exported by the package and
  it should produce the platform-specific configuration and install
  files (e.g. \verb+$NAME.config+ and \verb+$NAME.install+, see
  \S\ref{dotconfig} and \S\ref{dotinstall}).

\item The {\tt depends} and {\tt conflicts} fields contain formulas
  over package names, optionally parametrized by version
  constraints. An expression is either:

\begin{itemize}
\item A package name: {\tt "foo"};
\item A package name with version constraints:
  \verb+"foo" (>= "1.2" & <= "3.4")+
\item A disjunction of formulas: \verb+E | F+
\item A conjunction of formulas: \verb+E & F+
\item A formula with parenthesis: \verb+( E )+
\end{itemize}

For instance \verb+ "foo" (<= "1.2") & ("bar" | "gna" (= "3.14"))+
is a valid formula whose semantic is: {\em any version of package
  {\tt "foo"} lesser or equal to $1.2$ and either any version of
  package {\tt "bar"} or the version $3.14$ of package {\tt "gna"}.}
\\

\item The {\tt libraries} and {\tt syntax} fields contain the
  libraries and syntax extensions defined by the package.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Package configuration files: {\tt .config}}
\label{dotconfig}

\verb+$opam/OVERSION/config/NAME.config+ follows the syntax defined in
\S\ref{syntax}, with the following restrictions:

{\small
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
<file>    := <item>*
<item>    := <def> | <section>
<section> :=
    <kind> STRING {
      ?asmcomp:  [ STRING+ ]
      ?bytecomp: [ STRING+ ]
      ?asmlink : [ STRING+ ]
      ?bytelink: [ STRING+ ]
      ?requires: [ <dep>+ ]
      <def>*
    }
<dep>     := STRING 
           | STRING ( STRING+ )
<kind>    := library | syntax
<def>     := IDENT: BOOL
           | IDENT: STRING
           | IDENT: [ STRING+ ]
\end{Verbatim}
}

\verb+$NAME.config+ contains platform-dependent information which can
be useful for other libraries or syntax extensions wants to use
libraries defined in the package \verb+$NAME+.

\paragraph{Local and global variables}

The definitions {\tt IDENT: BOOL}, {\tt IDENT: STRING} and {\tt IDENT:
  [ STRING+ ]}, are used to defined variables associated to this
package, and are used to substitute variables in template files (see
\S\ref{subst}):

\begin{itemize}

\item \verb+%{$NAME}$VAR%+ will refer to the variable \verb+$VAR+
  defined at the root of the configuration file \verb+$config/NAME.config+.

\item \verb+%{$NAME.$LIB}$VAR%+ will refer to the variable \verb+$VAR+
  defined in the {\tt library} or {\tt syntax} section named
  \verb+$LIB+ in the configuration file \verb+$config/$NAME.config+.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Library and syntax sections}

Each {\tt library} and {\tt syntax} section defines an OCaml library
and the specific compilation flags to enable when using and linking
with this library.

The distinction between libraries and syntax extensions is only useful
at compile time to know whether the options should be used as
compilation or pre-processing arguments (ie. should they go on the
compiler command line or should they be passed to the {\tt -pp}
option). This is the responsibility of the build tool to do the right
thing and the {\tt <kind>} of sections is only used for documentation
purposes in OPAM. \\

The available options are:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt asmcomp} are compilation options to give to the native
  compiler (when using the {\tt -c} option)
\item {\tt bytecomp} are compilation options to give to the bytecode
  compiler (when using the {\tt -c} option)
\item {\tt asmlink} are linking options to give to the native compiler 
\item {\tt bytlink} are linking options to give to the bytecode
  compiler
\item {\tt requires} is the list of libraries and syntax extensions
  the current block is depending on. The full list of compilation
  and linking options is built by looking at the transitive closure of
  dependencies.

  The contents of {\tt deps} is either:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\tt "foo"} the block is depending on all the syntax
    extensions and libraries defined in the package {\tt "foo"}; or
  \item {\tt "foo" ("bar" "gna")} the block is depending only on the
    libraries {\tt "bar"} and {\tt "gna"} defined in the package {\tt
      "foo"}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Package installation files: {\tt .install}}
\label{dotinstall}

\verb+$opam/OVERSION/install/NAME.install+ follows the syntax defined
in \S\ref{syntax} with the following restrictions:

{\small
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
<file> :=
    ?lib:  [ STRING+ ]
    ?bin:  [ <mv>+ ]
    ?doc:  [ STRING+ ]
    ?misc: [ <mv>+ ]

<mv> := STRING
      | STRING ( STRING )
\end{Verbatim}
}

\begin{itemize}
\item Files listed under {\tt lib} are copied to \verb+$lib/$NAME/+.
\item Files listed under {\tt bin} are copied to \verb+$bin/+ (they
  can be renamed using \verb+$SRC ( $DST )+; in this case \verb+$SRC+
  should be a simple filename, ie. it should not start with a
  directory name).
\item Files listed under {\tt doc} are copied to \verb+$doc/$NAME/+.
\item Files listed under {\tt misc} should be processed as follows:
  for each pair \verb+$SRC ( $DST )+, the tool should ask the user if
  he wants to install \verb+$SRC+ to the absolute path \verb+$DST+.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Substitution files}
\label{subst}

All of the previous files can be generated using a special mode of
{\tt opam} which can perform tests and substitutes variables (see
\S\ref{opam-config} for the exact command to run). Substitution files
contains some templates which will be replaced by some contents. The
syntax of templates is the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item templates such as \verb+%{$NAME}$VAR%+ are replaced by the value
  of the variable \verb+$VAR+ defined at the root of the file
  \verb+$config/NAME.config+.

\item templates such as \verb+%{$NAME.$LIB}$VAR%+ are replaced by the
  value of the variable \verb+$VAR+ defined in the \verb+$LIB+ section
  in the file \verb+$config/PACKAGE.config$+

%% \item templates such as \verb+%{IF $test %{ $then %} THEN %{ $else %}}+ are
%%    replaced by \verb+$then+ if \verb+$test+ is either:
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item the ident {\tt true}
%% \item or a (global or local) variable whose value is the ident {\tt
%%   true}
%% \item or an expression \verb+$var1 = $var2+ or \verb+$var = STRING+ 
%%   where the contents of both sides of {\tt =} evaluates to the same
%%   value.
%% \end{itemize}
%% Otherwise, the template is replaced by \verb+$else+.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Client commands}

\subsubsection{Creating a fresh client state}
\label{opam-init}

When an end-user starts OPAM for the first time, he needs to
initialize \verb+$opam/+ in a consistent state. In order to do so, he
should run:

\begin{verbatim}
    $ opam init [-kind $KIND] $REPO $ADDRESS
\end{verbatim}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb+$KIND+ is the kind of OPAM repository (default is {\tt
  http});
\item \verb+$REPO+ is the name of the repository (default is {\tt
  default}); and
\item \verb+ADDRESS+ is the repository address (default is
  \verb+http://opam.ocamlpro.com/pub+).
\end{itemize}

This command will:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Create the file \verb+$opam/config+ (as specified in
  \S\ref{dotconfig})

\item Create an empty \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/installed+ file.

\item Initialize \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO+ by running
  \verb+'opam-$KIND-init $ADDRESS'+ (see \S\ref{script-update}). If
  the script cannot be found in the path, the command should be
  canceled and should return a well-defined error.

\item Symlink all OPAM and description files (ie. create a symbolic
  link from every file in \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/opam/+ to
  \verb+$opam/opam/+ and from every file in
  \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/descr/+ to \verb+$opam/descr/+).

\item Create \verb+$opam/repo/index+ and for each version
  \verb+$VERSION+ of package \verb+$NAME+ appearing in the repository,
  append the line \verb+'$REPO $NAME $VERSION'+ to the file.

\item Create the empty directories \verb+$opam/archives+,
  \verb+$lib/+, \verb+$bin/+ and \verb+$doc+/.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Listing packages}
\label{opam-list}

When an end-user wants to have information on all available packages,
he should run:

\begin{verbatim}
    $ opam list
\end{verbatim}

This command will parse \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/installed+ to know the
installed packages, and \verb+$opam/opam/*.opam+ to get all the
available packages. It will then build a summary of each packages. The
description of each package will be read in \verb+$opam/descr/+ if it
exists.

For instance, if {\tt batteries} version {\tt 1.1.3} is installed,
{\tt ounit} version {\tt 2.3+dev} is installed and {\tt camomille} is
not installed, then running the previous command should display:

\begin{verbatim}
    batteries   1.1.3  Batteries is a standard library replacement
    ounit     2.3+dev  Test framework
    camomille      --  Unicode support
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Getting package info}

In case the end-user wants a more details view of a specific package,
he should run:

\begin{verbatim}
    $ opam info $NAME
\end{verbatim}

This command will parse \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/installed+ to get the
installed version of \verb+$NAME+, will process
\verb+$opam/repo/index+ to get the repository where the package comes
from and will look for \verb+$opam/opam/$NAME.*.opam+ to get available
versions of \verb+$NAME+. It can then display:

\begin{verbatim}
    package: $NAME
    version: $VERSION                 # '--' if not installed
    versions: $VERSION1, $VERSION2, ...
    libraries: $LIB1, $LIB2, ...
    syntax: $SYNTAX1, $SYNTAX2, ...
    repository: $REPO
    description:
      $SYNOPSIS

      $LINE1
      $LINE2
      $LINE3
      ...
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Installing a package}
\label{opam-install}

When an end-user wants to install a new package, he should run:

\begin{verbatim}
    $ opam install $NAME
\end{verbatim}

This command will:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Compute the transitive closure of dependencies and conflicts of
  packages using the dependency solver (see \S\ref{deps}). If the
  dependency solver returns more than one answer, the tool will ask
  the user to pick one, otherwise it will proceed directly. The
  dependency solver should also mark the packages to recompile.

\item The dependency solver sorts the collections of packages in
  topological order. Them, for each of them do:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Check whether the package is already installed by looking for
  the line \verb+$NAME $VERSION+ in \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/installed+.
  If not, then:

\item Look into the archive cache to see whether it has already been
  downloaded. The cache location is:
  \verb+$opam/archives/$NAME.VERSION.tar.gz+

\item If not, process \verb+$opam/repo/index/+ to get the repository
  \verb+$REPO+ where the archive is available, get the repository kind
  by looking at \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/kind+ and then ask the
  repository to download the archive by calling
  \verb+opam-$KIND-download+ (see \S\ref{script-download}).

  Once this is done, symlink the archive in in \verb+$opam/archives+.

\item Decompress the archive into \verb+$build/$NAME.$VERSION/+.

\item Substitute the required files.

\item Run the list of commands to build the package with \verb+$bin+
  in the path.

\item Process \verb+$build/$NAME.$VERSION/$NAME.install+ to install
  the created files. The file format is described in \S\ref{dotinstall}.

\item Install the installation file
  \verb+$build/$NAME.$VERSION/$NAME.install+ in \verb+$install/+ and
  the configuration file \verb+$build/$NAME.$VERSION/$NAME.config+ in
  \verb+$config/+.

\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Updating index files}
\label{opam-update}

When an end-user wants to know what are the latest packages available,
he will write:

\begin{verbatim}
    $ opam update
\end{verbatim}

This command will follows the following steps:

\begin{itemize}

\item For each repositories in \verb+$opam/config+, run the
  appropriate \verb+opam-$KIND-update+ script (see
  \S\ref{script-update}).

\item For each repositories in \verb+$opam/config+, process
  \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/updated+ and update \verb+$opam/repo/index+,
  \verb+$opam/opam/+ and \verb+$opam/desc+ accordingly (ie. add the
  right lines in \verb+$opam/repo/index+ and create the missing
  symlinks). Here, the order in which the repositories are specified
  is important: the first repository containing a given version for a
  package will be the one providing it (this can be changed manually
  by editing \verb+$opam/repo/index+ later).

\item For each line \verb+$REPO $NAME $VERSION+ in
  \verb+$opam/repo/index+, if the version \verb+$VERSION+ of package
  \verb+$NAME+ has been modified upstream (ie. if the line
  \verb+$NAME $VERSION+ appears in \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/$updated+)
  and if the package is already installed (ie. it appears in
  \verb+opam/$OVERSION/installed+), then update
  \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/reinstall+ accordingly (for each compiler
  version \verb+$OVERSION+).

  Packages in \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/reinstall+ will be reinstalled (or
  upgraded if a new version is available) on the next {\tt opam
    upgrade} (see \S\ref{opam-upgrade}), with \verb+$OVERSION+ being
  the current compiler version when the upgrade command is run.

\item Delete each \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/$updated+

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Upgrading installed packages}
\label{opam-upgrade}

When an end-user wants to upgrade the packages installed on his host,
he will write:

\begin{verbatim}
    $ opam upgrade
\end{verbatim}

This command will:

\begin{itemize}

\item Call the dependency solver (see \S\ref{deps}) to
find a consistent state where {\bf most} of the installed packages are
upgraded to their latest version. Moreover, packages listed in
\verb+$opam/$OVERSION/reinstall+ will be reinstalled (or upgraded if a new
version is available). It will install each non-installed packages in
topological order, similar to what it is done during the install step,
See \S\ref{opam-install}.

\item Once this is done the command will delete
  \verb+$opam/$OVERSION/reinstall+.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Getting package configuration}
\label{opam-config}

The first version of OPAM contains the minimal information to be able
to use installed libraries. In order to do so, the end-user (or the
packager) should run:

\begin{verbatim}
    $ opam config -list-vars
    $ opam config -var {$NAME}$VAR
    $ opam config -var {$NAME.$LIB}$VAR
    $ opam config -subst $FILENAME+
    $ opam config [-r] -I        $NAME+
    $ opam config [-r] -bytecomp $NAME.$LIB+
    $ opam config [-r] -asmcomp  $NAME.$LIB+
    $ opam config [-r] -bytelink $NAME.$LIB+
    $ opam config [-r] -asmlink  $NAME.$LIB+
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb+-list-vars+ will return the list of all variables defined
  in installed packages (see \S\ref{dotconfig})
\item \verb+-var $var+ will return the value associated to the
  variable \verb+$var+
\item \verb+-subst $FILENAME+ replace any occurrence of
  \verb+%{$NAME}$VAR%+ and \verb+%{$NAME.$LIB}$VAR%+ as specified in
  \S\ref{subst} in \verb+$FILENAME.in+ to create \verb+$FILENAME+.
\item \verb+-I $NAME+ will return the list of paths to include when
  compiling a project using the package \verb+$NAME+ (\verb+-r+ gives
  a result taking into account the transitive closure of
  dependencies).
\item \verb+-bytecomp+, \verb+-asmcomp+, \verb+-bytelink+ and
  \verb+-asmlink+ return the associated value for the section
  \verb+$LIB+ in the file \verb+$config/$NAME.config+ (\verb+-r+ gives
  a result taking into account the transitive closure of all
  dependencies).
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Uploading packages}
\label{opam-upload}

When a packager wants to create a package, he should:

\begin{enumerate}

\item create \verb+$package/$NAME.$VERSION.opam+ containing in the format
  specified in \S\ref{dotopam}.

\item create a file describing the package

\item make sure the build scripts:
\begin{itemize}
\item build the libraries and packages advertised in
  \verb+$package/$NAME.$VERSION.opam+
\item generates a valid \verb+$package/$NAME.install+ containing the
  list of files to install (the file format is described in
  \ref{dotinstall}).
\item generates a valid \verb+$package/$NAME.config+ containing the
  configuration flags for libraries exported by this package (the file
  format is described in \ref{dotconfig}).
\end{itemize}

\item create an archive \verb+$NAME.$VERSION.tar.gz+ with the sources he
  wants to distribute.

\item run the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
    $ opam upload -opam $OPAM -descr $DESC -archive $ARCHIVE -repo $REPO
\end{verbatim}

This command will parser \verb+$OPAM+ to get the package name and
version and it will move \verb+$OPAM$+, \verb+$DESC+ and
\verb+$ARCHIVE+ in \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/upload/$NAME.$VERSION+ (with
the right filenames). It will then call \verb+opam-$KIND-upload+ to
upload the files upstream (see \S\ref{script-upload}).

This command will work only for writable repositories; in case of
errors (for instance if the repository is read-only) the script
returns a non-zero exit code and stores the error message in
\verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/error+ (see \S\ref{script-error}).

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Removing packages}
\label{opam-remove}

When the user wants to remove a package, he should write:

\begin{verbatim}
    $ opam remove $NAME
\end{verbatim}

This command will check whether the package \verb+$NAME+ is installed,
and if yes, it will display to the user the list packages that will be
uninstalled (ie. the transitive closure of all forward-dependencies).
If the user accepts the list, all the packages should be uninstalled,
and the client state should be let in a consistent state.

\subsubsection{Managing OPAM repository}

When the user wants to manage OPAM repositories, he should write:

\begin{verbatim}
    $ opam repository -list
    $ opam repository -rm $REPO
    $ opam repository -add [-kind $KIND] $REPO $ADRESS
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb+-list+ lists the current repositories by looking at
  \verb+$opam/config+
\item \verb+$-rm $REPO$+ deletes \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO+ and removes
  \verb+$REPO+ from the {\tt repositories} list in \verb+$opam/config+.
  Then, for each package in \verb+$opam/repo/index+ it updates the link
  between packages and repositories (ie. it either deletes packages or
  symlink them to the nex repository containing the package).

\item \verb+$-add [-kind $KIND] $REPO $ADDRESS+ initializes
  \verb+$REPO+ as described in \S\ref{opam-init}.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Dependency solver}
\label{deps}

Dependency solving is a hard problem and we do not plan to start from
scratch implementing a new SAT solver. Thus our plan to integrate (as
a library) the Debian depency solver for CUDF files, which is written
in OCaml.

\begin{itemize}
\item the dependency solver should run on the client; and
\item the dependency solver should take as input a list of packages
  (with some optional version information) the user wants to install,
  upgrade and remove and it should return a consistent list of
  packages (with version numbers) to install, upgrade, recompile and
  remove.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{OPAM repository scripts}
\label{scripts}

As stated above, OPAM repositories can be of different kinds. A given
kind \verb+$KIND+ has associated scripts \verb+opam-$KIND-init+,
\verb+opam-$KIND-update+, \verb+opam-$KIND-download+ and
\verb+opam-$KIND-upload+ which should behave in the way specified
below.

\subsubsection{Init script}
\label{script-init}

\begin{verbatim}
    $ opam-$KIND-init $opam/repo/$REPO $ADDRESS
\end{verbatim}

This script should contact the OPAM repository located at address
\verb+$ADDRESS+ and create \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO+ as specified in
\S\ref{state-repo}.

\subsubsection{Update script}
\label{script-update}

\begin{verbatim}
    $ opam-$KIND-update $opam/repo/$REPO
\end{verbatim}

This script should get the list of newly available packages, by
contacting the OPAM repository whose address is specified in
\verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/address+. It should then create (or update)
\verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/updated+ accordingly. It should also create (or
update) the OPAM files stored in \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/opam+ and the
description files stored in \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/descr+.

\subsubsection{Download script}
\label{script-download}

\begin{verbatim}
    $ opam-$KIND-download $opam/repo/$REPO $NAME $VERSION
\end{verbatim}

This script should get \verb+$NAME.$VERSION.tar.gz+ from the OPAM
repository whose address is stored in \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/address+.
It should then move the archive file into \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/archives/+ and
overwrite the previous file if one is already there.

\subsubsection{Upload script}
\label{script-upload}

\begin{verbatim}
    $ opam-$KIND-init $opam/repo/$REPO
\end{verbatim}

This script should send the contents of
\verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/upload/+ to the repository whose address is
stored in \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/address+ and remove the folder
contents when it's done.

\subsubsection{Error handling}
\label{script-error}

In case any of the above scripts return with a non-zero exit code, the
full error message will be stored into \verb+opam/repo/$REPO/error+

\subsubsection{HTTP repository}

The first Milestone includes the necessary scripts to support {\tt
  http} repositories. In order to do so:

\begin{itemize}

\item The HTTP repository should export a filesystem identical to the
  one which will be created in \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO+.

\item \verb+opam-http-init $PATH $ADDRESS+ simply runs something like:

\begin{verbatim}
    $ cd $PATH && wget $ADDRESS/opam && wget $ADDRESS/descr
\end{verbatim}

(it might use {\tt rsync} or {\tt ftp} instead of {\tt wget})

\item \verb+opam-http-download $PATH $NAME $VERSION+ will simply run
  something like:

\begin{verbatim}
    $ cd $PATH && wget $ADDRESS/archives/$NAME.$VERSION.tar.gz
\end{verbatim}

\item \verb+opam-http-update $PATH+ will also run {\tt wget} and
  filter the command output to populate \verb+$opam/repo/$REPO/updated+ accordingly.

\item \verb+opam-http-upload $PATH+ will return an error: the server
  state can only be updated manually by copying the new files in the
  right place on the server filesystem.

\end{itemize}

\section{Milestone 2: OPAM server}
\label{server}

The only OPAM repository kind available in Milestone 1 is {\tt http}.
This second milestone describes the implementation of an OPAM
repository using a custom binary protocol (ie. not relying on HTTP)
between a client and a server. This is intended to be the preferred
way to upload new packages to OPAM repositories.

\subsubsection{Server state}

In this section, {\tt \$opamserver} refers to the filesystem subtree
containing the server state. Default directory is {\tt
  \$home/.opam-server}.

\subsubsection{Getting the list of packages}

\label{getList}
\begin{verbatim}
    val getList   : repo -> (name * version) list 
    val updateList: repo -> (name * version) list
\end{verbatim}

\verb+getList $HOSTNAME+ returns the full list of available packages. This
command is intended to be run only once, when the repository
\verb+$HOSTNAME+ is initialized.\\

\verb+updateList $HOSTNAME+ updates the given repository and returns
the list of newly available packages. For repositories not using the
custom OPAM protocol (eg. not starting by \verb+opam://+) this means
running the script \verb+$opamserver/$HOSTNAME/update+ which should
return a list of lines of (package name, version) pairs using the same
format as described in \S\ref{installed}.

\subsubsection{Getting OPAM files}
\label{getOPAM}

\begin{verbatim}
    val getOPAM: repo -> (name * version) -> opam
\end{verbatim}

{\tt getOPAM repo (name,version)} returns the corresponding OPAM
filename as an absolute location in the filesystem (which should be .

\subsubsection{Getting description files}
\label{getOPAM}

\begin{verbatim}
    val getDescr: repo -> (name * version) -> descr
\end{verbatim}

{\tt getDescr repo (name,version)} returns the corresponding
description file.

\subsubsection{Getting package archive}
\label{getArchive}

\begin{verbatim}
    val getArchive: repo -> (name * version) -> archive
\end{verbatim}

{\tt getArchive repo (name,version)} returns the corresponding package
archive.

\subsubsection{Uploading new archives}
\label{newArchive}

\begin{verbatim}
    val newArchive: repo -> (opam * archive) -> unit
\end{verbatim}

{\tt newArchive(opam,archive)} takes as input an OPAM file and the
corresponding package archive, and upload the server state. This
function works only for READ-WRITE repository. In case of a READ-ONLY
one, a suitable error message is returned to the user.

\subsubsection{Binary Protocol}

In case of READ-WRITE repositories, the server state can be queried
and modified by any OPAM clients, using the following binary protocol

\begin{itemize}

\item Communication between clients and servers always start by an
hand-shake to agree on the protocol version.

\item All the basic values (names, versions and binary data) are
  represented as OCaml strings.

\item More complex values are marshaled using a simple binary
  protocol: the first byte represents the message number, and then
  each message argument is stacked in the message with its size as
  prefix. The list of messages {\em from the client to server} is:

{\small
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Client-to-Server Message & Arguments & Description \\
\hline
\hline
\verb+GetList+ & -- & Ask for the list of all OPAM files \\
\hline
\verb+GetOPAM+ & \verb+name   : string+ & Ask for the binary representation of \\
               & \verb+version: string+ & a given OPAM file \\
\hline
\verb+GetArchive+ & \verb+name   : string+ & Ask for the binary representation of \\
                  & \verb+version: string+ & a given archive file \\
\hline
\verb+NewArchive+ & \verb+name   : string+ & Create a new package on the
server. \\
                  & \verb+version: string+ & The client should provide
the OPAM file \\
                  & \verb+opam   : string+ & and the source archive. \\
                  & \verb+archive: string+ & \\
\hline
\verb+UpdateArchive+ &  \verb+name   : string+ & Update a new version
of a given \\
                  & \verb+version: string+ & package on the
server. The client \\
                  & \verb+opam   : string+ & should also provide a security key\\
                  & \verb+archive: string+ & \\
                  & \verb+key    : string+ & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
}

\item Answers from the server are encoded in the same way (ie, a byte
  for the message number, followed by optional arguments prefixed by
  their size). List arguments are encoded by stacking first the
  lenght, and then all the elements of the list in sequential order.
  The list of messages {\em from servers to clients} is:

{\small
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Server-to-Client Message & Arguments & Description \\
\hline
\hline
\verb+GetList+      & \verb+list   : (string*string) list+ & Return the list
of available \\
 & & package names and versions \\
\hline
\verb+GetOPAM+      & \verb+opam   : string+ & Return an OPAM file \\
\hline
\verb+GetArchivwe+  & \verb+archive: string+ & Return an archive file \\
\hline
\verb+NewArchive+   & \verb+key    : string+ & Return a security key \\
\hline
\verb+UpdateArchive+& --                     & The update went OK \\
\hline
\verb+Error+        & \verb+error  : string+ & An error occurred \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
}

\end{itemize}

Note that when an error is raised by an arbitrary function
 at server side, the client receives \verb|Error _|.



\section{Milestone 3: Link Information}

This milestone focuses on adding the right level of linking
information, in order to be able to use packages more easily.


\section{Milestone 4: Server Authentication}

This version focuses on server authentication.

\subsection{RPC protocol}

The protocol should be specified (using either a binary format or a
JSON format).

\subsection{Server authentication}

The server should be able to ask for basic credential proofs. The
protocol can be sketched as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item packagers store keys in {\tt \$opam/keys/NAME}. These keys are
  random strings of size 128.

\item the server stores key hashes in {\tt
  \$opamserver/hashes/NAME}.

\item when a packager wants to upload a fresh package, he still uses
  {\tt newArchive}. However, the return type of this function is
  changed in order to return a random key. OPAM clients then stores
  that key in {\tt \$opam/keys/NAME}.

\item when a packager wants to uplaod a new version of an existing
  package, he uses the function {\tt val updateArchive: (opam * string
    * string) -> bool}. {\tt updateArchive} takes as argument an OCaml
  value representing the OPAM file contents, the archive file as a
  binary string and the key as a string. The server then checks
  whether the hash of the key is equal to the one stored in {\tt
    \$opamserver/hashes/NAME}; if yes, it updates the
  package and return {\tt true}, if no if it returns {\tt false}.

\item packager email should be specified in {\tt NAME.opam}:

\end{itemize}

\section{Milestones 6: Pre-Processors Information}

This milestone focus on the support of pre-processors.

\subsection{Getting package preprocessor options}

The user should be able to run:

\begin{verbatim}
    $ opam-config -bytepp NAME
    $ opam-config -asmpp NAME
\end{verbatim}

This command will return the command line option to build the
preprocessor exported by package {\tt NAME}.

In order to do so, packagers should describe exported preprocessors in
the corresponding {\tt NAME}.descr:

\begin{verbatim}
syntax foo {
  requires: bar, gni         // list of syntax dependencies
  pp: -parser o -printer p   // common options to asmpp and bytepp
  bytepp: ...
}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Milestones 7: Support of Multiple Compiler Versions}

This milestone focus on the support of multiple compiler versions.

\subsection{Compiler Description Files}

For each compiler version {\tt OVERSION}, the client and server states
will be extended with the following files:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt \$opam/compilers/OVERSION.comp}
\item {\tt \$opamserver/compilers/OVERSION.comp}
\end{itemize}

Each {\tt .comp} file contains:

\begin{itemize}

\item the location where this version can be downloaded. It can be an
  archive available via {\tt http} or using CVS such as {\tt svn} or
  {\tt git}.

\item eventual options to pass to the configure script. {\tt
  --prefix=\$opam/OVERSION/} will be automatically added to these
  options.

\item options to pass to {\tt make}.

\item eventual patch address, available via {\tt http} or locally on
  the filesystem

\end{itemize}

For instance, {\tt 3.12.1+memprof.comp} (OCaml version $3.12.1$ with
the memory profiling patch) looks like:

\begin{verbatim}
src:       http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.12/ocaml-3.12.1.tar.gz
build:     world world.opt
patches:   http://bozman.cagdas.free.fr/documents/ocamlmemprof-3.12.0.patch
\end{verbatim}

And {\tt trunk-tk-byte.comp} (OCaml from SVN trunk, with no {\em tk}
support and only in bytecode) looks like:

\begin{verbatim}
src:       http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.12/ocaml-3.12.1.tar.gz
configure: -no-tk
build:     world
\end{verbatim}
